## Contributor Code of Conduct

By contributing, you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of this repository.

## Get Started

For you to contribute to this project, kindly follow these simple steps religiously.

1. Open an Issue: this should contain a brief summary of what your contribution is all about. Whether it is a new resource to be added,
   a bug fix, improvements and so on.

In addition, adding labels to your issues is greatly appreciated.

2. Fork the repo:

3. Clone your forked version of the repo:

4. Install necessary dependencies (optional): If you are just adding a new resource, you might not need to do this.

We prefer `yarn` package manager,

## Guidelines

Firstly, this repo is meant for FREE resources only! In the form of PDFs, DOCs and free online course and so on.
They must be a direct link to the resources, without any redirection or third-party site!

### Structure

There are three major folders in the repo:

- books
- courses
- docs

Each of these folders contain category sub-folder, please kindly put the resource you are adding under the appropriate folder. For example, if you are adding a coding e-book on React, the appropriate location should be: `books > dev-books > React > react.md`. The same rule applies to other kinds of resources.

- The `books` folder is meant for direct links to FREE tech e-books in PDF and DOC formats preferably.
- The `courses` folder is meant for direct links to FREE online courses around tech subjects.
- The `docs` folder is meant for direct links to FREE documentation, articles and discussions around any tech subjects.

### Formatting

- Please when contributing, arrange it in alphabetical order.

- If the name of the resource you are adding begins with a number or special character, kindly add it at the very bottom of the appropriate list.

- The format should be in a markdown link with a target as '\_blank'. For example:

```
[Eloquent JavaScript](#Link-to-eloquent-javascript){:target="_blank"}
```

This document will be further improved on, as time goes on.
Thank you!
